#Library Management System
#Scope of Work: Library Management System (C++ Project)
    Introduction
    For this project, Iâ€™m building a Library Management System using C++. 
    The goal is to create a simple but functional system that helps manage books, users, and borrowing activity. 
    I want to focus on practical features that reflect how real libraries operate while improving my skills in object-oriented programming, file handling, and system design.
#Purpose
      The system will allow librarians (or users) to:
      Add and remove books from the catalog
      Search for books by title or author
      Register users and track who borrowed what
      Record borrowing and returning of books
      View reports of available books and borrowing history
#Scope
        Book Management: Add, delete, update book records (title, author, ISBN, quantity)
        User Management: Register users with basic info (name, ID)
        Borrowing System: Track which user borrowed which book and when
        Return System: Update records when books are returned
        File Storage: Use text files to save and load data (books, users, transactions)
#Tools and Technologies
        Language: C++
        Development Tools: VS Code, GitHub
#Goal
        Build a working system that handles basic library operations
        Practice using classes, file handling, and modular code in C++
        Create something I can show in my portfolio or improve later
#What problem does it solve
        Organize book records efficiently
        Track borrowing and returning with timestamps
        Store user information and borrowing history
        Prevent data loss by saving everything to files
        Make library operations faster, more accurate, and easier to manage
