#Descrption: prompt the user what he wants to do, something, for example ADD,VIEW and DELETE
HE can add by entering  1,View by entering  2 and Exit by entering 3



#function:
VIEW();
ADD();
EXIT();


so using condtion(IF/ELSE) based on user input we call a specific function to perfom that task.




All this happens utill user inputs 3 which Call the EXIT();function and exit the loop.
